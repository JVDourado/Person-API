# Person-API
An people management API REST with Spring boot (Version 1.0)

The intent of the project is to develop a small system for managing people in a company through a API REST, created with Spring Boot.

During the course, the following topics were developed and addressed:

- Initial project setup with Spring Boot Initialzr
- Creating a data model for mapping entities into databases
- Development of user management operations (Registration, reading, updating and removal of people from a system).
- Relationship of each of the above operations with the REST architectural standard, and the explanation of each of the REST concepts involved during the project development.
- Cloud system deployment through Heroku


Disclaimer: During the development of the project there were some problems, in which I am working hard, to finalize the project
